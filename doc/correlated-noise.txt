It's quite possible that we'll need to fit models (of, e.g., data cubes)
with correlated noise. In these cases, simple MCMC crawling will not
recover true model params, because the noise model is incorrect.

We will instead want to fit a model that already contains correlated noise,
i.e., non-zero off-diagonal elements in the covariance matrix. A nice piece
of code for this is "george," which can be accessed on github, and read about
here: http://dan.iel.fm/george/current/user/model/
